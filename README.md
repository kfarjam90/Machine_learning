## Problem: Automated Breast Cancer Diagnosis
Context
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial to increase the chances of effective treatment and recovery. However, manual analysis of imaging tests can be time-consuming and prone to human error. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop automated systems that can assist doctors in detecting and classifying breast lesions.
### Methodology
  1. Data Exploration: Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of features and their correlations.

  2.Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values (if any), normalization/standardization of features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

  3.Model Selection: Evaluation of different classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

  4.Training and Validation: Training the models using cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization.

  5.Evaluation: Evaluating the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC).

  6.Implementation: Choosing the best-performing model and implementing it in a diagnostic support system.
